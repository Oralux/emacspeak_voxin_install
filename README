This installer builds emacspeak 45.0 with espeak or voxin.

Emacs (>=24) must be installed before running this script.
Voxin (>=1.00) is optional and available at:
http://voxin.oralux.net

To launch the installer, just type as root in a terminal:
./install.sh

The proposed instruction to launch emacspeak will be displayed at the
end of the script; you may want to copy it in your .bashrc file.

For example, if you have installed emacspeak in the $DIR directory,
then the instruction with espeak will be:
alias emacspeak "emacs -q -l $DIR/emacspeak-setup.el -l $HOME/.emacs"

For using voxin by default, set also the DTK_PROGRAM variable to
outloud:
alias emacspeak "DTK_PROGRAM=outloud emacs -q -l $DIR/emacspeak-setup.el -l $HOME/.emacs"
